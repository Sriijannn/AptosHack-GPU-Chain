# GPU-Chain ⛓️

> [cite_start]Your Uber for GPUs [cite: 2]

[cite_start]GPU-Chain is a decentralized marketplace built on the Aptos blockchain [cite: 3][cite_start], designed to connect GPU owners with users who need computational power[cite: 14]. [cite_start]We unlock underutilized global GPU resources, making high-performance computing accessible and affordable for everyone[cite: 3].

## [cite_start]🚀 The Problem: The GPU Access Gap [cite: 5]

[cite_start]The current landscape of GPU accessibility is broken, creating a significant barrier to innovation and fostering digital inequality[cite: 12].

* [cite_start]**Underutilized Resources**: Thousands of powerful GPUs sit idle around the world[cite: 7]. [cite_start]Owners of this hardware often lack a simple and secure way to monetize their assets[cite: 8].
* [cite_start]**Costly & Limited Access**: High-end GPUs, like RTX 4090s, are prohibitively expensive for many individuals and small teams[cite: 10]. [cite_start]Existing cloud solutions from major providers are often rigid and come with high costs[cite: 11].

[cite_start]Current peer-to-peer solutions are often technically unreliable, charge high fees, and suffer from a lack of trust and reputation systems[cite: 16, 17].

## [cite_start]✨ Our Solution: GPU-Chain on Aptos [cite: 13]

[cite_start]GPU-Chain directly solves these issues by creating a decentralized, peer-to-peer network that is fair, transparent, and efficient[cite: 18].

* [cite_start]**For GPU Owners**: Easily list your idle hardware, set custom pricing, and turn dormant GPUs into a steady income stream[cite: 19, 20, 21]. [cite_start]A transparent dashboard helps you track earnings and performance[cite: 22].
* [cite_start]**For Users**: Get instant, on-demand access to powerful GPUs for AI, gaming, rendering, and more[cite: 23, 24, 26]. [cite_start]Our smart search allows you to filter by model, location, and price to find the perfect match[cite: 25].

## 🌟 Key Features

* [cite_start]**🔒 Secure Transactions via Aptos**: We use the Aptos blockchain for fast, secure, and transparent rental agreements through Move smart contracts[cite: 28, 29]. [cite_start]Payments are locked in an escrow smart contract and are only released upon successful task completion, guaranteeing fairness for both parties[cite: 31, 32, 33].
* [cite_start]**🤝 Peer-to-Peer Networking**: By leveraging WebRTC (via PeerJS), we establish direct, low-latency connections between the user and the GPU provider, ensuring seamless and efficient task processing[cite: 34, 35, 36].
* [cite_start]**🌍 Global Reach**: Our platform connects GPU owners and users from anywhere in the world, maximizing the utilization of global computing resources[cite: 37, 38, 39].

## [cite_start]⚙️ How It Works: Workflow Overview [cite: 62]

Our process is designed to be seamless and secure from start to finish.

1.  [cite_start]**Rental Request**: A renter selects a GPU and submits a rental request[cite: 41]. [cite_start]The payment is then locked into an Aptos escrow smart contract[cite: 41].
2.  [cite_start]**Owner Acceptance**: The GPU owner accepts the request, and this confirmation is recorded on the Aptos blockchain[cite: 42].
3.  [cite_start]**P2P Connection & Task Execution**: Our backend matches the two parties, establishes a secure WebSocket connection via PeerJS, and launches a GPU worker inside a Docker container to run the task[cite: 55].
4.  [cite_start]**Settlement**: Once the task is successfully completed, the Aptos smart contract automatically releases the escrowed funds to the GPU owner[cite: 44]. [cite_start]If the task fails, the funds are refunded to the renter[cite: 44].

[cite_start]All agreements and transactions are handled fully on-chain[cite: 43].
